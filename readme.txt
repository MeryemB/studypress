StudyPress offers several ways to integrate lessons and quizzes on your web site

<br>2- If you want to integrate a lesson or a quiz in a page you can copy the short code, present in the created post and past it in your page.
<br>3- Since a course is a set of lessons and quizzes, you don't have to integrate it in a page or a post. You have just to add it into your site menu as a menu element. Go to "Appearance" -> "Menus" -> "Course", check your course and click "Add to Menu".

<br>If you have not activated yet the course option in the menu dashboard, you have to go to "Dashboard" -> "Appearance" -> "Menus" -> "Screen options" -> and check "Course"
